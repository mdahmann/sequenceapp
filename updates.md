## 5. Sequence Visualization
- [ ] Add a flow-chart view showing pose connections
- [ ] Create a timeline view showing intensity progression
- [ ] Add visual markers for repeated sequences
- [ ] Include energy/intensity graphs
- [ ] Show pose relationships (prep poses, counter poses)

## 6. Practice Structure
- [ ] Add section markers (Warm-up, Standing Series, Floor Series, etc.)
- [ ] Include traditional sequencing principles
- [ ] Add peak pose preparation pathways
- [ ] Include cool-down and counter-pose suggestions
- [ ] Add meditation and pranayama integration points

## 7. Customization and Flexibility
