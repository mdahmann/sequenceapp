# Technical Requirements
- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind stack
- Latest Next.js features and best practices
- Supabase integration for backend
- Follow design-guide.md for styling

# Development Process
1. Think step-by-step before coding
2. Write clear, readable, bug-free code
3. Reference filenames explicitly
4. No TODOs or placeholders
5. If unsure, ask don't guess

# Critical Project Rules
1. NO drastic changes without explicit request
2. Design changes must:
   - Keep component structure
   - Preserve functionality
   - Only change requested visuals
   - Maintain state/data flow

3. Always reference:
   - updates.md for feature tracking
   - design-guide.md for styling
   
4. Test thoroughly:
   - Light/dark modes
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Accessibility
   - Error states
   - Loading states

IMPORTANT PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES:
1. NEVER make drastic changes to existing functionality unless explicitly requested
2. When implementing design changes:
   - Keep existing component structure intact
   - Maintain current functionality
   - Only modify requested visual elements
   - Preserve state management and data flow
   - Don't modify existing props/interfaces unless explicitly requested

3. Always check updates.md for:
   - Flow and repetition features
   - Mini-sequence implementation
   - Timing and rhythm features
   - Teaching tools integration
   - Sequence visualization needs
   - Practice structure requirements
   - Customization options

4. Core Feature Areas (reference updates.md):
   - Bilateral pose markers
   - Flow blocks and repetitions
   - Build-up sequences
   - Flow templates
   - Teacher signature flows
   - Breath markers and timing
   - Pose cues and modifications
   - Flow charts and visualizations
   - Warm-up/cool-down structure
   - User customization options

5. Implementation Guidelines:
   - Test both light/dark modes
   - Verify mobile responsiveness
   - Maintain accessibility
   - Keep loading states
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Follow brutalist design aesthetic
   - Use Space Grotesk typography
   - Follow color system in design-guide.md
